# website-validator
A dotnet application that crawls a website checking for http 404s and maybe more stuff later

Intended usage:
```
websitevalidator https://www.yourdomain.whatever
```

Output: 

A big json file with a lot of information.
A part of it being the structure of the website,
but also a list of validation messages from
your validators.
So you can use that information for further 
automation.
